# Unified Multimodal AI Framework for Healthcare Applications

This repository contains the implementation of a cutting-edge AI-driven framework designed to integrate and analyze multimodal healthcare data (e.g., medical images, clinical notes, radiology reports) into a unified reasoning pipeline. The system incorporates advanced techniques such as Bayesian uncertainty quantification, cross-modal contrastive learning, knowledge distillation, and human-in-the-loop validation to ensure reliable, scalable, and privacy-preserving solutions for healthcare applications.

 Overview

The Unified Multimodal Reasoning (UMR) Platform integrates multiple modalities (text, images, structured data) into a single reasoning pipeline using meta-learning, probabilistic modeling, and deep learning. It addresses challenges such as hallucinations in large vision-language models (LVLMs), multi-modal fusion, and uncertainty quantification. The platform is designed for applications in healthcare, autonomous systems, and scientific research.

Key Features:
- Cross-Modal Fusion: Combines imaging, text, and structured data into a unified representation.
- Uncertainty Quantification: Uses Bayesian inference, deep ensembles, and Dirichlet-based calibration to quantify model confidence.
- Human-in-the-Loop Validation: Dynamically incorporates expert feedback to improve model performance.
- Hallucination Mitigation: Reduces hallucinations in LVLMs using retrieval-augmented reasoning (RAR) and contrastive learning.

 Methodology

 Key Components
1. Data Preprocessing and Multi-Modal Fusion:
   - Adaptive image preprocessing with domain-specific normalization (e.g., Hounsfield Units for CT scans).
   - Augmented textual data processing with BioBERT embeddings and ontology enrichment.
   - Cross-modality alignment loss ensures semantic consistency between modalities.

2. Mitigating Hallucinations:
   - Knowledge Distillation with Retrieval-Augmented Reasoning (RAR-KD) anchors outputs in factual information.
   - Cross-modal contrastive learning aligns image and text embeddings.
   - Bayesian uncertainty quantification identifies high-risk predictions for expert review.

3. Unified Multimodal Reasoning (UMR):
   - Agent interaction with attention-based message passing.
   - Dynamic attention mechanism adjusts focus based on query complexity.
   - Multi-turn reasoning with feedback-driven updates improves decision-making over time.

4. Uncertainty Quantification:
   - Bayesian inference captures both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty.
   - Temperature scaling and Dirichlet-based calibration enhance softmax probability calibration.
   - Adaptive thresholding dynamically flags uncertain predictions.

5. Human-in-the-Loop Validation:
   - Expert feedback is dynamically weighted based on prediction uncertainty and contextual relevance.
   - Meta-learning adapts uncertainty handling mechanisms across tasks.

 Measurement Metrics

The following metrics are implemented to evaluate the performance of the system:

1. Factuality Score:
   - Measures the factual correctness of generated medical reports by comparing them with ground truth.

2. Precision and Recall:
   - Evaluates the retrieval of clinically relevant knowledge snippets.

3. Hallucination Rate:
   - Quantifies the proportion of factually inaccurate or unsubstantiated content.

4. Cross-Modal Alignment Index (CMAI):
   - Measures semantic alignment between medical images and their textual descriptions using cosine similarity.

5. Dice Coefficient:
   - Evaluates the accuracy of pathological feature extraction in medical images.

6. Epistemic Uncertainty Quantification:
   - Includes predictive entropy and mutual information to quantify uncertainty.

7. Hallucination Reduction Rate (HRR):
   - Assesses the reduction in hallucination rates compared to a baseline model.

8. Clinical Consistency Score (CCS):
   - Integrates diagnostic accuracy, treatment recommendation accuracy, and medical information coherence.

9. Expected Calibration Error (ECE):
   - Measures the calibration of predicted probabilities.

10. Meta-Learning Loss:
